# Title using header one
This is great fun. Getting to learn markdown with actual practice. I will be an expert by the end of the week.

## Title using header two
Yeah, this heading looks kinda small compared to the first one I say. Lets try header three, shall we.

### Lets add some code

```python
# this is a comment not a heading
print("Hello there, this is Markdown")
```
### Title using header three
True, it smaller compared to the others.
